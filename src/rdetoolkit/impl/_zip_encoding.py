"""Shared helpers for extracting ZIP archives whose filenames are not UTF-8.

The ZIP specification only guarantees the filename encoding when general purpose
bit 11 (the language encoding flag, ``0x800``) is set, in which case the name is
UTF-8. When the flag is absent, :mod:`zipfile` falls back to decoding the raw
bytes as cp437 for historical reasons. Archives produced on Japanese Windows
store filenames as cp932, so cp437 decoding turns ``2θ_θ.TXT`` into
``2â╞_â╞.TXT``.

Because cp437 maps every byte to a character, that mis-decoding is lossless and
therefore reversible: re-encoding the mojibake string as cp437 recovers the
original bytes, which can then be decoded with the true encoding.

    reliable: it reads ``NB1_800_20220214_2θ_θ.TXT`` as cp949 and ``データ.txt``
