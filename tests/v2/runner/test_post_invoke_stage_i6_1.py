"""Post-invoke artifact stage for Session I6-1 (rulings #4 and #8b).

The v1 pipelines publish tile artifacts *after* the dataset callback returns:
raw/nonshared copies, thumbnails, the structured invoice copy, magic-variable
substitution and the feature description update, each behind its own config
gate (``processing/factories.py``). v2 only performed the raw and thumbnail
steps, and ``InvoiceService.apply_config`` had no caller at all.

Every test below runs the real Runner against a real fixture and observes real
files: no mock objects, no patched collaborators. The two ordering probes are
subclasses of the injectable artifact services that record filesystem state and
then delegate to the real implementation, so the observed behavior is the
production behavior.
