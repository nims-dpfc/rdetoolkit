"""Tests for rdetoolkit v2 runner tile path resolution (TC-PATH-001..007).

Written before implementation (TDD Red phase).
Target: make all tests pass in codex-worker Green phase.

Design authority: local/develop/v2/Design.md §6.3, §6.4, §4.2 (v2.1 R3)
Session authority: local/develop/v2/tasks/session_b2.md (B2.1/B2.2)

Divided/ rule (v1-compatible, StorageDir.__nDigit == 4):
    idx == 0 -> directly under base_dir (no ``divided/`` segment)
    idx >= 1 -> base_dir/divided/{idx:04d}/

``resolve_tile_paths`` MUST NOT create any directory on disk (no ``mkdir``);
directory creation is owned exclusively by Runner step 4a. Its return value
must expose the ten canonical output-kind attributes (Design §4.2) so that
``OutputContext.from_resource_paths(...)`` can adapt it into an
``OutputContext`` instance.
