"""Tests for rdetoolkit v2 event-stream completeness through a real
Runner.run() (Session D2, TC-EVT-completeness-001/002).

Written before implementation (TDD Red phase).
Target: make all tests pass in codex-worker Green phase.

Design authority: local/develop/v2/Design.md v2.1 §8.1/§8.2.
Session authority: local/develop/v2/tasks/session_d2.md Conflict #7 -- the
node.* event bridge is upgraded from D1-optional (Decision D1-C) to
D2-required: it must be replayed from ExecutionResult.call_records
(NodeCallRecord tuples, seq order) so every observed @node call also becomes
a node.started/node.completed (or node.failed) event.

Pinned ordering contract:
    run.started -> (iteration.started -> node.* -> iteration.completed) x N
    -> run.completed, in that exact order; every event carries a non-empty
    run_id shared by the whole run. A failed tile emits node.failed (never
    node.completed) before its iteration.completed.

Note: report/events.py's Event factories are out of this session's edit
boundary (session_d2.md Boundaries clause) and are frozen as-is;
Event.iteration_completed() carries no status field, so this file does not
assert on iteration.completed's payload content for the failure case --
only on event *ordering*, which is fully observable without editing
events.py.
