Session D2 addendum (invoice construction, decisions_pre_D2.md Ruling 1):

    TC-EP-D2-001/002 -- invariant modes (invoice/multidatatile/rdeformat):
        invoice/invoice.json is read ONCE per run and the same non-None
        InvoiceData is injected into every tile's RunContext.invoice.
        Missing invoice.json behaves exactly like v1 -- these tests reuse
        rdetoolkit.domain.invoice.load_invoice's existing contract
        (FileNotFoundError, see TC-EP-002 above) rather than inventing new
        semantics.
    TC-EP-D2-003/004 -- per-row modes (excelinvoice/smarttable): a per-tile
        invoice.json is built by delegating to v1 machinery. This test file
        pins the concrete delegation functions this session adds to
        rdetoolkit.domain.invoice (Design.md/PhaseD_prompts.md leave the
        exact names to this session):
