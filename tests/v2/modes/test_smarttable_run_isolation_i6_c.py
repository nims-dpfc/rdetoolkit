"""Session I6-C: SmartTable runs sharing one root stay independent.

Before I6-C the base invoice lived in a v1 **class** attribute keyed by the
resolved source path, and the run boundary evicted that key process-wide. Two
runs over one root therefore shared one snapshot, and starting a run could
evict the snapshot a concurrently executing run was still using. The base
invoice is now owned by the run's ``InvoiceService``.

Equivalence partitions (EP):

| API | Partition | Rationale | Expected | Test ID |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ``InvoiceService.prepare_tile`` | two runs, one root, source replaced | overlapping runs | each keeps its own snapshot | TC-I6-C-CONC-001 |
| ``InvoiceService.begin_run`` | second run starts mid-first-run | no global eviction | first run's snapshot survives | TC-I6-C-CONC-002 |

Boundary values (BV):

| API | Boundary | Rationale | Expected | Test ID |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ``InvoiceService.prepare_tile`` | two threads, one root, two different base invoices | minimum real concurrency, discriminating content | each run's tiles carry its own snapshot | TC-I6-C-CONC-003 |
